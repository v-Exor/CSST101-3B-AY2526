      Advanced Presentation and Reasoning is a core subject that develops students' ability to communicate complex technical ideas effectively and think critically in problem-solving contexts. The course emphasizes advanced presentation skills, logical reasoning, and structured argumentation, which are essential for conveying research findings, project proposals, and technical solutions in both academic and professional settings.
